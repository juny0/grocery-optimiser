# grocery-optimiser
This is a proof-of-concept recipe book application with the goal to minimize food waste in meal planning/prepping and grocery shopping.

## TIMELINE:
- main.py is a draft of the backend
- After backend is finished, increase usability by making a frontend somehow (ideally an easy frontend)
- If energy and time remains, turn into mobile app (iOS)

### How to get started?
You can inspect the database file (named 'recipe_db_file.sqlite' as of July 11, 2018) by:
- Opening the database file by running `sqlite3 recipe_db_file.sqlite` (there might be another way to do this but I couldn't figure it out
- If you want to see the table names, type `.tables`
